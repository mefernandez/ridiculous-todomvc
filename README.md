==================

A fun experiment to see how much software architecture can be stuffed into a Spring.io based TODO list Java web application.

Goal
----

Build a Java web application based on [TODO MVC](http://todomvc.com/) project and try to fit in as much frameworks, Java language features, and enterprise patterns as possible.

Examples of things that can be added are: 
- Spring.io projects: [Spring Security, etc.](http://spring.io/docs)
- Java concurrency / multithreading features
- Enterprise patterns. [Here's a bunch of them](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterprisePatterns.html)
- Integration and Testing stuff: Jenkins, JMeter, etc.

Rules
-----

1. Every added software architecture feature must contribute to the functionality of the application.
2. Every added software architecture feature must be well behaved with the existing ones.
3. The final result must have tests in place to check the new feature works fine.
4. The final result must be added to the overall architecture diagram.
